        <p>Across a body of work that spans photography, video, and installations, Nadim Asfar’s early works engage with the technical and experimental origins of image-making. In <a href="#">Hyper Images (2007-2008)</a>, for instance, he employs a camera-less photographic technique—the photogram—that is as old as photography itself to produce a series of floral “photogenic drawings” that are as much records of action as they are still lives disconnected from recognizable spatial and temporal markers. The registration of action, both of photographed subject and the act of photographic capture itself, animates the artist’s projects. In <a href="#">Habiter Le Jour (2004-2008)</a>, images register the bodies of anonymous passersby, as observed and captured from the balcony of the artist’s home-laboratory-studio. As faceless figures cast shadows under the hard city light, heading in undisclosed directions, their narratives are only announced, never told. <a href="#">Everyday Madonna (2010)</a> a video completed a couple of years later, communicates a saturation or exhaustion of the household as repository and producer of images. Moving around the same space from which the photographs that make Habiter Le Jour were taken, the camera wanders around the confines of the interior, lingering over objects, the play of light and shadow on a wall, still images, moving images on television… The space of dwelling is constructed and disassembled as a series of events, however mundane or minute, binding the space with a continuous flow of images and sounds. Each of Asfar’s work is characterized by a schema or system of observation that governs the interactions between apparatus, body, and space. In Habiter Le Jour, the scheme revolves around a fixed position. <a href="#">Experiencing The Mountain (2015-ongoing)</a> is an expansive photographic series of the mountainous Lebanese countryside that conveys the meticulousness and of an ambulant land surveyor. With <a href="#">Territorial Waters (2015)</a> as its prologue, Experiencing The Mountain marks a departure or new direction in the artist’s work, from an engagement with the technical potentialities of the photographic apparatus as such, to a more thematic engagement with historical mediums and traditions, such as landscape. How does one de-nationalize a landscape at once arid and fertile, long-domesticated as a national emblem and tradition in Lebanese painting? How does one pair, sonically and visually, the impersonal vastness of sea and the volatility of one’s interior voice? How does one move across and register the all-too-familiar textures of the walls, streets, and fabrics of domestic space against the faces and surfaces of a city that is increasingly de-familiarized? One can say that Asfar encounters and apprehends things and phenomena by photographing them, each element exerting its own set of forces, restrictions, and potentialities on the act of capture, whether it’s the play of light and shadow in a living room at dusk, or the topographic complexity of the Lebanese landscape.</p>
